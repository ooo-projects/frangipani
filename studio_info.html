<span class = "faq">
<br><br>
What is this service?
<br>
<span class = "answer">Studio Static is a web design and development practice. Through it, artist Oritsemughone Ogbemi <mark>creates elegant, responsive websites</mark> for other artists and their organizations using plain html & css.</span>
<br><br>
How does it work?
<br>
<span class = "answer">Interested artists <u><span data-tally-open="pbyoEV" data-tally-layout="modal" data-tally-width="333">fill out a form.</span></u> After that, the process of building your website occurs in four stages:
<ul>
<li><b>Stage 1:</b> A 45-minute call to talk through your ideas</li>
<li><b>Stage 2:</b> A drafting period, during which I create a <u style = "text-decoration-style: wavy;">sample site</u> for you to review. This will usually involve two rounds of feedback and take ~three weeks.</li>
<li><b>Stage 3:</b> Publication of your approved website. The site is also connected to a domain name, if you have one.</li>
<li><b>Stage 4:</b> A final training call (45 mins), during which I show you how to update your website when you need to.</li>
</ul>
</span>
